# Thematic Raster Requirements

The thematic raster file to be edited must satisfy the following criteria:

- **Categorical thematic layer** with byte or integer data type. ThRasE only works with integer values, not continuous data.
- **Pixel-value/color association** if not present, ThRasE will prompt you to apply a temporary random association

## Supported symbology:

### 1. Thematic with Paletted or Singleband Pseudocolor

Use any raster (byte or integer data type) with a specific style loaded from a QGIS project or QML file, or applied on the fly in QGIS.

- **Paletted/Unique values** (recommended)
- **Singleband pseudocolor** (using `Exact Interpolation`, `Equal Interval` mode, number of classes must match layer classes)

  ```{tip}
  After configuring the style in QGIS, save it as a `.qml` style file by going to `Style` â†’ `Save as Default`. Otherwise, you'll lose the pixel-value/color association if you restart QGIS.

  **Alternative:** Save all layer styles in a QGIS project.
  ```

### 2. Thematic with Embedded Color Table

Use any raster (byte or integer data type) that has pixel-value/color associations stored in its metadata color table. View this using `gdalinfo` or in the `Symbology` tab in layer `Properties` (shown as `Paletted`).
