ThRasE integrates with the Continuous Change Detection (CCD) plugin to enhance your thematic raster editing workflow. The CCD plugin helps analyze trends and breakpoints of change over multi-year time series at specific locations through Google Earth Engine while you edit your thematic raster.

- **Temporal pattern analysis** at specific points of interest
- **Multi-source support** for both Landsat and Sentinel data
- **Spectral trend visualization** and detected breakpoints
- **Change detection** - identification of gradual and abrupt changes over time
