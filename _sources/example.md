This example provides a sample dataset to demonstrate the capabilities of ThRasE using a demo of a scenario. The data covers the Tinigua National Natural Park in Colombia, an area with a high rate of deforestation, and showcases forest land change between 2019 and 2020.

The thematic map includes the following classes:
*   Stable Forest (class 1)
*   Non-Stable Forest (class 5)
*   Deforestation (class 2)

The example also includes mean composite maps for each year as a reference data.
