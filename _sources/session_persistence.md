ThRasE supports session persistence through save and restore functionality that captures your complete workspace state. This capability is essential for multi-session workflows where you need to maintain consistency across editing or review periods.

- **Multi-session workflow support** - maintain consistency across editing or review periods
- **Team collaboration** - share standardized configurations to ensure uniform inspection methodology
- **Resume capability** - resume work exactly where you left off, preserving both spatial progress and workspace setup

```{tip}
Inside the configuration YAML file, ThRasE saves relative paths for all layers configured with respect to the YAML fileâ€™s location, but only when those layers are in the same directory or a subdirectory of the YAML file. This ensures the project remains portable and easy to share.
```

```{important}
**Web/network layers** - if using web or network layers (Google, Esri, Google Earth Engine, XYZ), first save and load your QGIS project, then load the ThRasE configuration file (`.yaml`)
```
