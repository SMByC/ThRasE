changelog=
    25.6:
    - Integrating the Continuous Change Detection (CCD) plugin inside the ThRasE plugin. CCD helps to analyze the trends and breakpoints of change of the samples over multi-year, using Landsat and Sentinel throught Google Earth Engine.
    - Refactoring the UI setting up the active layers and edition tools configuration buttons in the main dialog
    - Refactor navigation tool handling in the main dialog
    - New feature to set the maximum number of layer rows that can be displayed and overlaid per view
    - Add the nodata value in black within the new symbology when nodata is unsetted and is not present in the symbology
    - Several icons improvements and fixes
    - Improve many tooltips, messages, text, descriptions and docs
    - Enhance map coordinate text to include projection/CRS information
    - Remove limits on undo/redo actions. After some testing these historical undo/redo actions, they don't consume much memory, so there's no reason to set limits on this ThRasE feature.
    - ThRasE now will save and restore relative paths from the YAML file if the layers are in the same directory or subdirectory tree as the YAML file, making it a portable and shareable project.
    - Update the save dialog for the ThRasE configuration YAML file, set the default extension as .yaml
    - Handle locale initialization to fix some issues for some edge cases loading the plugin
    - Other minor fixes and improvements
