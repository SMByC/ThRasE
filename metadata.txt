description=A powerful and flexible Thematic Raster Editor QGIS plugin with an additional navigation tool to ensure systematic layer inspection
about=ThRasE is a powerful and flexible QGIS Python plugin for fast thematic raster editing. It utilizes a recode pixel table to modify multiple classes simultaneously using various tools, including pixels, lines, polygons, and freehand drawing. The plugin also features a navigation tool to facilitate systematic layer inspection.

changelog=
    25.8:
    - Implement the registry tool widget for pixel modification tracking to review pixel changes over time
    - Implement the button to export all registered modified pixels to a vector file, where each feature is a square polygon representing the pixel modified with the attributes: old_value, new_value, edit_date
    - Implement saving and restoring of pixel logs and registry configuration and state from/to Thrase yaml file
    - Add optional registry recording changes in the thematic class global editing tool
    - Refactored the process for storing editing events and edited pixels using the PixelLog and EditLog classes, registering unique pixel edits by time and improving the overall editing workflow. Implemented QGISâ€™s geometry engine to optimize and improve performance of contains operations for polygon and freehand editing tools.
    - Add auto-clear functionality for drawing tools
    - Enhance layout or multiples view widgets with vertical and horizontal separators between them
    - Refactor edit logging to use per-view history of edit actions for pixel, line, polygon, and freehand tools
    - Add enable/disable functionality for the pixel change registry
    - Only use GDAL for editing the whole-image function and catch any error in the process
    - Set undo/redo buttons with a delay for pixel, line, polygon, and freehand to avoid issues in processing undo/redo actions for fast clicks
    - Add the functionality to delete the entire pixel change registry
    - Update navigation tiles color on color change without rebuild navigation
    - Block wheel events on all QComboBoxes in Thrase dialog to prevent unwanted changes to selected items
    - Fixing some issues in restoring configuration settings
    - Disable and enable the registry button and widget based on layer selection
    - Remove borders and adjust the layout margins of the CCD plugin for improvement integration
    - Improve caching hash value in Pixel class
    - Add group ID for pixel edits to track edit sessions
    - Adjust edited pixels status messages
    - Enable/disable editing toolbars if recode pixel table is empty
    - Store/restore pixel tolerance handling and registry for current editing layer
    - Set pixel tolerance for comparison based on pixel size
    - Another rename related variables and methods
    - Refactor typos in functions, variables, files names
    - Avoid RuntimeError in edge cases with deleted plugin objects
    - Improving and adjusting warning and error bar messages
    - Minor UI and others
    - Refine some icons
