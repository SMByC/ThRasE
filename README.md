# ThRasE

![](docs/img/thrase.svg)

ThRasE is a powerful and fast thematic raster editor Qgis plugin, it uses a recode pixel table to modify several classes at the same time using pixels, lines, polygons or freehand tools. The plugin has an additional navigation tool to ensure layer inspection.

   > ThRasE is a tool for editing thematic or categorical raster layers, it means raster with integer values ([read more](https://smbyc.github.io/ThRasE/#thematic-raster-to-edit)). If you want to edit raster with float values you can use [serval](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/Serval/) plugin for that.
