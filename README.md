# ThRasE

![](docs/img/thrase.svg)

ThRasE is a powerful and flexible QGIS Python plugin for fast thematic raster editing. It utilizes a recode pixel table to modify multiple 
classes simultaneously using various tools, including pixels, lines, polygons, and freehand drawing. The plugin also 
features a navigation tool to facilitate layer inspection.

The plugin serves multiple purposes, including but not limited to:

* Editing/reclassifying thematic maps
* Creating thematic maps from scratch
* Labeling images for tasks such as semantic segmentation
* Creating training data for machine learning models
* Refining agricultural maps
* Updating urban planning maps
* Classifying/fix land cover types
