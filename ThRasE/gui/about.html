<h1>ThRasE - Thematic Raster Editor</h1>
<p><i>version: {version}</i></p>

<p>ThRasE is an open-source QGIS plugin that provides rigorous editing for systematic post-classification correction and quality assurance of thematic rasters. It provides synchronized multi-panel views for side-by-side and overlap comparison with reference data, a recode pixel table to modify multiple classes in one operation, modification tracking for transparency, tile-based navigation to ensure complete coverage, and session persistence.</p>

<p>Developed within IDEAM's Forest and Carbon Monitoring System (SMByC), ThRasE is an official component of Colombia's Digital Image Processing Protocol for Quantifying Deforestation. Research teams and monitoring programs worldwide use the plugin to correct land-use/land-cover misclassifications, annotate training datasets, validate thematic products, refine agricultural maps, among other applications.</p>
